# es6-lisp
#### A quick n' dirty lisp interpreter in modern es6.

I wrote this as an exercise one evening. It's mostly a translation of [Norvig's minimal python lisp](http://norvig.com/lispy.html).

It's written in modern es6 as transpiled by babel. See .babelrc for settings.

TODO:
 - Add REPL
 - Add remaining functions from Norvig's examples.
 - Try out some Little Schemer examples.
